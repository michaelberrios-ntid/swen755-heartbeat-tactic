## Team Members:
- Michael Berrios
- Devaj Mody

## Overview
This project demonstrates the Heartbeat Tactic in a perception subsystem through both C and C# implementations. We made meaningful contributions to design, implementation, and documentation.

### Devaj’s Contributions
- Designed and implemented the initial heartbeat monitor in C
- Developed the Makefile and socket testing setup
- Created the final sequence diagram for the C# implementation
- Participated in discussions on failover, sensor recovery, and cluster design
- Helped shape the transition from low-level C to object-oriented C#

### Michael’s Contributions
- Developed the multi-threaded C# TCP-based system
- Implemented sensor fallback logic and automatic failover with SensorRegistry
- Created the final UML class diagram reflecting the complete system
- Integrated Devaj’s core ideas into a cross-platform, scalable solution
- Managed architectural separation (SensorService, Monitor, Shared)

## Conclusion
This project is the result of shared effort and inspiration. Devaj's early C prototype and sequence diagram guided the overall tactic, while Michael extended it into a robust C# implementation. We contributed to design discussions via Discord, architecture, and final deliverables.
